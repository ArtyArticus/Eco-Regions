  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.gibbon": "Gibbons fascinate scientists due to their agility in the forest treetops. Gibbons are excellent brachiates and this is one reason they make popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, gibbons live in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair and their dependent offspring. These family groups form vocal displays consisting of a spectacular duet between the mated pair, with the young occasionally joining in. This vocalisation, or song, is audible for long distances and are one of the primary way scientists locate wild populations.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.gibbon_0": "Siamangs are arboreal, black-furred gibbons native to the Malay Peninsula and Sumatran rain and monsoon forests. They are the largest of the gibbons and use their throat sacs to vocalize, making a deep boom or high-pitched \"wow\" sound. Unfortunately, like most species of Gibbon, they are listed as Endangered by the IUCN red list.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.gibbon_1": "Lar gibbons are native to southeast Asia and are largely found in tropical forests in Thailand, Malaysia and on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. Fruit makes up a large part of this primates’ diet in the wild, and they also eat flowers, insects and leaves. Sadly, Lar Gibbons are threatened in various ways, including habitat destruction, hunting and capture for the wildlife pet trade. Currently, there are rehabilitation sanctuaries within Thailand for the Lar Gibbon.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.gibbon_2": "White-Cheeked Gibbons are a sexually dimorphic species, meaning that males and females have different coat colourings. While males have black hair all over their bodies with the exception of their distinct white cheeks, females are reddish/grey in colour, with dark brown/black hair fur on the crown of their head and back of the neck. One of the most distinctive features of the White-Cheeked Gibbon is their long arms, up to 1.4 times as long as the legs.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.gibbon_3": "The Yellow-Cheeked Gibbons is found in South Vietnam, Laos and north-eastern Cambodia. The Yellow-cheeked crested gibbon owes its name to its distinctive colouration:  the males have a black fur with only the cheeks being yellow, whereas the females and the newly born are of a bright yellow colour. It is little known about the species and there are no real records of how many still exist in the wild. They are listed as Endangered by the IUCN red list.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.gibbon_4": "This primate can today be found in tropical forests and dense evergreens, but only in the regions of southeast Thailand and northwest Cambodia, Asia. The Pileated Gibbon is a sexually dimorphic species, Males have a black fur, while the females have a white–grey coloured fur with only the belly and head being black.  There is thought to be around 65,000 pileated gibbons remaining in the wild today. Their main threat is habitat loss, with the wild forest they live in being converted into farmland. ",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.gibbon_5": "The Bornean gibbon, also known as the grey gibbon or Müller’s gibbon, is endemic to the island of Borneo, which is split between the nations of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. They occur throughout southeast Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of the island, compromising 73% of the island’s area. The southwest region of the island is home to the closely related Bornean white-bearded gibbon. They are listed as Endangered by the IUCN red list.",

Unfortunately, they have a damaging effect on the already disrupted British biodiversity, as there is no Apex Predator to hunt them, causing overgrazing.",

They are iconic for the male’s shaggy beard and their iconic spiral horns, reaching 4ft average in usually two full spiral rotations.  Their size makes them key prey for wild dogs and lions, but also for trophy hunters looking for a specimen.

They can be kept alongside other species, such as capybara, tapir & anteater, if the other species are given opportunities to escape!",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.screamer_0": "While it has the same physical traits as its Northern cousin, the southern screamer has unique white freckles on its chest and neck and a white ring close to the bottom of the head.  Its activity levels are similar but is theorized to make local movement patterns when seasons change but not to the degree to be migratory.  Their massive range combined with good numbers leaves the species as Least Concern.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.screamer_1": "Unlike most other bird species, this screamer spends most time doing very little activity nor do they travel far.  However, their minimal behavior turns around in breeding season, when males constantly fight for the rights of the females.  Farmers find them active year round, considering them as a pest for certain crops.  The hunting of them and their non-expanding range leaves them Near Threatened.",

All members are at high risk of extinction from human exploitation of the species and their habitat.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.tree_kangaroo_0": "While representing a color structure somewhat similar to the Matschie’s, this species has equidistant and equal sized legs.  This combined with strong claws for gripping and a large tail for balance, an arboreal life is easy for them.  Unfortunately, they are hunted as a means of food and victims of the logging industry, leaving the declining population Endangered.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.tree_kangaroo_1": "This species is the most recognized tree kangaroo for the average public.  They have cream lower feet, snout markings, and underbelly while the rest of the body is an orange-brown color.

  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.tree_kangaroo_2": "The ursine tree-kangaroo is a long-tailed, furry, bear-like mammal endemic to the tropical forests of New Guinea. Slightly larger than a cat, they live alone, in trees, and are active at night to feed on leaves and fruit. They have a very limited range and are declining in numbers; by at least 30% within the last 30 years. The two main threats it faces are habitat destruction and hunting by indigenous peoples for food.",
  "informational_blurb.ecoregions.tree_kangaroo_3": "The grizzled tree-kangaroo is native to tropical, foothill rainforests of northern and western New Guinea and some offshore islands. It can be found at elevations up to 1,400 m (4,600 ft) above sea level. It is an uncommon animal and its population is believed to be declining though its range and numbers have not been well studied. Despite being a lesser known species, they are equally as intriguing.",
